## Hello, friends at MultiTracks!

Here are some notes on my solution:

- I badly wanted to connect the API to the UI project, but did not want to take any additional time. As a result, you can simply run that project and use the Swagger UI to test it.	
- I also ran into some issues with getting the connection string once I began running the API project. I googled and tried so many things, but utltimately ended up hard-coding the connection string in the SQL.cs file to verify that my API calls would work.

Thank you so much for taking the time to review my project!

Looking forward to hearing from you!
